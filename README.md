# Data Structures, Algorithms, and Multithreading in Java

Welcome to the repository for data structures, algorithms, and multithreading examples implemented in Java! This repository serves as a resource for learning and practicing essential concepts in computer science and software engineering.

## Contents

1. **Data Structures**: Implementation of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, etc., along with common operations and algorithms associated with them.

2. **Algorithms**: Implementation of fundamental algorithms like sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort), searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search), graph algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search, depth-first search), dynamic programming, etc.

3. **Multithreading**: Examples demonstrating multithreading concepts in Java, including thread creation, synchronization, communication between threads, and handling concurrent access to shared resources.

4. **Assessment**: Assessment exercises and challenges aimed at testing your understanding of data structures, algorithms, and multithreading concepts. These may include coding exercises, problem-solving tasks, and algorithmic puzzles.

## Usage

You can browse through the directories to find implementations of specific data structures, algorithms, or multithreading examples. Each directory contains Java source code files along with comments explaining the logic and functionality.

### Building and Running Tests

This project uses Maven as the build tool. To build the project and run tests, you can use the following Maven commands:

```bash
mvn clean install
